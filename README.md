## Overview

**Easy Search** is a minimal search solution that crawls a specified URL (and related pages on the same domain) to build an index of page content. Once the crawl and indexing are complete, the application exposes a web interface (powered by Flask) for searching the indexed content.

### How It Works

1. **Crawling**: The web crawler starts at `base_url` and follows links on the same domain, extracting textual content from each page.  
2. **Indexing**: The crawler uses [Whoosh](https://pypi.org/project/Whoosh/) to create or update a search index stored in the `indexdir` directory.  
3. **Searching**: A Flask route (`/word_search`) allows users to enter a query, which is searched against the Whoosh index. Results are displayed with titles, snippets, and links.
